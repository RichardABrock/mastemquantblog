I was interested to see if this had an effect on their scores in the tested domains of reading, maths and science. I had a couple of hypothesis to check that work in opposite directions.\n\n### *Hypothesis 1 - A Positive Correlation*\n\nWorking in free time during non-school hours displays a strong work ethic and hence that same work ethic could be applied to school work too.\n\n### *Hypothesis 2 - A Negative Correlation*\n\nWorking in their free time has an opportunity cost, every hour spent working is an hour that could have been spent studying, resulting in a negative impact on PISA score.\n\n### *The Statistical Methodology*\n\nUsing R I took the PISA 2022 dataset, averaged the three scores (reading, maths and science) of each pupil to get a total score for each pupil (SCORE_AVG).\n\nI realised that certain countries with different levels of economic development and different cultures surrounding children working may also have different PISA scores so I came up with a modified pupil score relative to the scores of their own country, this score represents the number of standard deviations a student is away from the average score of their own country (STU_REL_SCORE) so for example a value of -0.55 would mean that student had an average score in the three domains that was 0.55 standard deviations below the country average score. This was then compared against the number of times a student had worked during the week.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(arrow)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning:\n  It appears that you are running R and Arrow in emulation (i.e. you're\n  running an Intel version of R on a non-Intel mac).

The times worked per week as contained within the PISA dataset is a categoric variable so in order to do a linear plot it needs to be made into a numeric variable first so the little bit of code below does that before then plotting a line graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_score <- PISA_2022 %>% \n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, WORKPAY) %>% \n  mutate(SCORE_AVG = ((PV1MATH + PV1READ + PV1SCIE)/3)) %>% \n  group_by(CNT) %>% \n  mutate(CNT_AVG_SCORE = mean(SCORE_AVG)) %>%\n  mutate(CNT_SD_SCORE = sd(SCORE_AVG)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(STU_REL_SCORE = ((SCORE_AVG-CNT_AVG_SCORE)/CNT_SD_SCORE)) %>% \n  select(CNT, SCORE_AVG, CNT_AVG_SCORE, CNT_SD_SCORE, STU_REL_SCORE, WORKPAY) %>%\n  mutate(WORKPAY = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY, y=STU_REL_SCORE)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  ggtitle(\"How working affects student scores across the world\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student average score normalised relative to own country\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Working-Graph_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich does show more clearly a negative correlation between times worked per week when times is less than 5. The correlation gets a little more noisy after that. I speculate this is because working more than 5 times per week would mean working more than every weekday, which might mean students answering the questionnaire with larger numbers may be defining a \"working\" period differently than those answering with smaller values or perhaps have misread the question making the data noisier for values over 5.\n\nOne thing in discussion with Peter and Richard I realised was that this model while it takes account of differences in economic status by country, it does not take into account differences in socioeconomic status between students. It is completely plausible that even within a country poorer students might be having to work more than richer ones, and it fairly established that students with lower socioeconomic status get lower scores on PISA tests (OECD, 2018). This might mean that all we are seeing in this graph is that effect, rather than any effect from working in a job. To remedy this we can adapt our model to control for socioeconomic status.\n\n### CONTROLING FOR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (ESCS)\n\nFirst of all let's see if there is a relationship between a student working in a job and their ESCS.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_score <- PISA_2022 %>% \n  select(WORKPAY, ESCS) %>% \n  mutate(WORKPAY = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY, y=ESCS)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  ggtitle(\"Do low socioeconomic status students work more times a week?\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student socioeconomic status\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 8320 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 8320 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_summary()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Working-Graph_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### REFERENCES\n\nOECD.
