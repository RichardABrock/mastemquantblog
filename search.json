    "text": "Looking through the questions asked on the PISA_2022 dataset I saw that the number of times a student had worked a job during the week was included as WORKPAY. I was interested to see if this had an effect on their scores in the tested domains of reading, maths and science. I had a couple of hypothesis to check that work in opposite directions.\n\n\n\nWorking in free time during non-school hours displays a strong work ethic and hence that same work ethic could be applied to school work too.\n\n\n\nWorking in their free time has an opportunity cost, every hour spent working is an hour that could have been spent studying, resulting in a negative impact on PISA score.\n\n\n\nUsing R I took the PISA 2022 dataset, averaged the three scores (reading PV1READ, maths PV1MATH and science PV1SCIE) of each pupil to get a total score for each pupil (SCORE_AVG).\nI realised that certain countries with different levels of economic development and different cultures surrounding children working may also have different PISA scores so I came up with a modified pupil score relative to the scores of their own country, this score represents the number of standard deviations a student is away from the average score of their own country (STU_REL_SCORE) so for example a value of -0.55 would mean that student had an average score in the three domains that was 0.55 standard deviations below the country average score. This was then compared against the number of times a student had worked during the week (WORKPAY).\nHere is the code:\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[PISA_student_2022_subset.parquet]\")\n\navg_score &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, WORKPAY) %&gt;% \n  mutate(SCORE_AVG = ((PV1MATH + PV1READ + PV1SCIE)/3)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CNT_AVG_SCORE = mean(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(CNT_SD_SCORE = sd(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(STU_REL_SCORE = ((SCORE_AVG-CNT_AVG_SCORE)/CNT_SD_SCORE)) %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, SCORE_AVG, CNT_AVG_SCORE, CNT_SD_SCORE, STU_REL_SCORE, WORKPAY) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY))\n\nWhen plotted this results in the following graph:\n\n# Define a custom function to map original levels to shorter labels\nmap_workpay_labels &lt;- function(original_label) {\n  # Define mapping for each level\n  level_mapping &lt;- c(\n    \"No work for pay\" = \"zero\",\n    \"1 time of working for pay per week\" = \"one\",\n    \"2 times of working for pay per week\" = \"two\",\n    \"3 times of working for pay per week\" = \"three\",\n    \"4 times of working for pay per week\" = \"four\",\n    \"5 times of working for pay per week\" = \"five\",\n    \"6 times of working for pay per week\" = \"six\",\n    \"7 times of working for pay per week\" = \"seven\",\n    \"8 times of working for pay per week\" = \"eight\",\n    \"9 times of working for pay per week\" = \"nine\",\n    \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" = \"more than ten\"\n  )\n  \n  # Use the level_mapping to map the original_label to the shorter label\n  return(level_mapping[original_label])\n}\n\n# Apply the custom function to the \"WORKPAY\" column\navg_score$WORKPAY &lt;- sapply(avg_score$WORKPAY, map_workpay_labels)\n\n# Convert \"WORKPAY\" to a factor with desired order of levels\navg_score$WORKPAY &lt;- factor(avg_score$WORKPAY, levels = c(\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"more than ten\"))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY, y=STU_REL_SCORE)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"lightblue\")+\n  ggtitle(\"How working affects student scores across the world\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student average score normalised relative to own country\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nIn which there does seem to be a negative correlation between number of times a student works and their relative score.\nThis is made clearer if we remove the violin distribution plots and just look at the averages. The times worked per week as contained within the PISA dataset is a categoric variable so in order to do a linear plot it needs to be made into a numeric variable first so the little bit of code below does that before then plotting a line graph.\n\navg_score &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, WORKPAY, ESCS) %&gt;% \n  mutate(SCORE_AVG = ((PV1MATH + PV1READ + PV1SCIE)/3)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CNT_AVG_SCORE = mean(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(CNT_SD_SCORE = sd(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(STU_REL_SCORE = ((SCORE_AVG-CNT_AVG_SCORE)/CNT_SD_SCORE)) %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, SCORE_AVG, CNT_AVG_SCORE, CNT_SD_SCORE, STU_REL_SCORE, WORKPAY,ESCS) %&gt;%\n  mutate(WORKPAY_numeric = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY_numeric))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY_numeric, y=STU_REL_SCORE)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)+\n  ggtitle(\"How working affects student scores across the world\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student average score normalised relative to own country\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nWhich does show more clearly a negative correlation between times worked per week when times is less than 5. The correlation gets a little more noisy after that. I speculate this is because working more than 5 times per week would mean working more than every weekday, which might mean students answering the questionnaire with larger numbers may be defining a “working” period differently than those answering with smaller values or perhaps have misread the question making the data noisier for values over 5.\nOne thing in discussion with Peter and Richard I realised was that this model while it takes account of differences in economic status by country, it does not take into account differences in socioeconomic status between students. It is completely plausible that even within a country poorer students might be having to work more than richer ones, and it is fairly established that students with lower socioeconomic status get lower scores on PISA tests (Tessier 2018). This might mean that all we are seeing in this graph is that effect, rather than any effect from working in a job. To remedy this we can adapt our model to control for socioeconomic status (ESCS).\n\n\n\nFirst of all let’s see if there is a relationship between a student working in a job and their ESCS.\n\nescs_vs_work &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(WORKPAY, ESCS) %&gt;% \n  mutate(WORKPAY_numeric = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY_numeric)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(ESCS))\n\nggplot(data = escs_vs_work,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY_numeric, y=ESCS)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)+\n  ggtitle(\"Do low socioeconomic status students work more times a week?\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student socioeconomic status\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nClearly there is a negative correlation, students who work more times per week are also of lower socioeconomic status. An interesting aside that I cannot explain is that odd working times per week lower than 5 have higher ESCS and even working times above 5 have higher ESCS. I think this may be because the WORKPAY category is a composite category made from two questions “How many times in the last week did you work for pay after school?” and “How many times in the last week did you work for pay before school?” This is pure speculation but perhaps there is some difference in ESCS between students who work before and after school, and the way the two questions are being aggregated is showing that up. I could possibly use the full PISA data set to look at the responses to those individual questions but that would perhaps be a distraction from the current investigation.\nLet’s compare the correlations between WORKPAY and ESCS to see how much they are correlated.\n\ncor.test(escs_vs_work$WORKPAY_numeric, escs_vs_work$ESCS, method = \"pearson\")\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  escs_vs_work$WORKPAY_numeric and escs_vs_work$ESCS\nt = -50.101, df = 529231, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.07138745 -0.06602455\nsample estimates:\n        cor \n-0.06870649 \n\n\nWhile the relationship is incredibly significant (p &lt; 2.2e-16), there is only a small negative correlation (-0.0687).

Given the negligible correlation between WORKPAY and ESCS and the weak to moderate correlations between WORKPAY, ESCS and STU_REL_SCORE we can be fairly confident that WORKPAY does have an effect on STU_REL_SCORE. However to find out how much of a effect WORKPAY is having we can do a multiple linear regression controlling for ESCS.\n\nlibrary(easystats)\nmodel &lt;- lm(STU_REL_SCORE ~ WORKPAY_numeric + ESCS,\n            data=avg_score)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = STU_REL_SCORE ~ WORKPAY_numeric + ESCS, data = avg_score)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.8889 -0.6290 -0.0027  0.6252  4.3940 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

    "text": "Looking through the questions asked on the PISA_2022 dataset I saw that the number of times a student had worked a job during the week was included as WORKPAY. I was interested to see if this had an effect on their scores in the tested domains of reading, maths and science. I had a couple of hypothesis to check that work in opposite directions.\n\n\n\nWorking in free time during non-school hours displays a strong work ethic and hence that same work ethic could be applied to school work too.\n\n\n\nWorking in their free time has an opportunity cost, every hour spent working is an hour that could have been spent studying, resulting in a negative impact on PISA score.\n\n\n\nUsing R I took the PISA 2022 dataset, averaged the three scores (reading PV1READ, maths PV1MATH and science PV1SCIE) of each pupil to get a total score for each pupil (SCORE_AVG).\nI realised that certain countries with different levels of economic development and different cultures surrounding children working may also have different PISA scores so I came up with a modified pupil score relative to the scores of their own country, this score represents the number of standard deviations a student is away from the average score of their own country (STU_REL_SCORE) so for example a value of -0.55 would mean that student had an average score in the three domains that was 0.55 standard deviations below the country average score. This was then compared against the number of times a student had worked during the week (WORKPAY).\nHere is the code:\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[PISA_student_2022_subset.parquet]\")\n\navg_score &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, WORKPAY) %&gt;% \n  mutate(SCORE_AVG = ((PV1MATH + PV1READ + PV1SCIE)/3)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CNT_AVG_SCORE = mean(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(CNT_SD_SCORE = sd(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(STU_REL_SCORE = ((SCORE_AVG-CNT_AVG_SCORE)/CNT_SD_SCORE)) %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, SCORE_AVG, CNT_AVG_SCORE, CNT_SD_SCORE, STU_REL_SCORE, WORKPAY) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY))\n\nWhen plotted this results in the following graph:\n\n# Define a custom function to map original levels to shorter labels\nmap_workpay_labels &lt;- function(original_label) {\n  # Define mapping for each level\n  level_mapping &lt;- c(\n    \"No work for pay\" = \"zero\",\n    \"1 time of working for pay per week\" = \"one\",\n    \"2 times of working for pay per week\" = \"two\",\n    \"3 times of working for pay per week\" = \"three\",\n    \"4 times of working for pay per week\" = \"four\",\n    \"5 times of working for pay per week\" = \"five\",\n    \"6 times of working for pay per week\" = \"six\",\n    \"7 times of working for pay per week\" = \"seven\",\n    \"8 times of working for pay per week\" = \"eight\",\n    \"9 times of working for pay per week\" = \"nine\",\n    \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" = \"more than ten\"\n  )\n  \n  # Use the level_mapping to map the original_label to the shorter label\n  return(level_mapping[original_label])\n}\n\n# Apply the custom function to the \"WORKPAY\" column\navg_score$WORKPAY &lt;- sapply(avg_score$WORKPAY, map_workpay_labels)\n\n# Convert \"WORKPAY\" to a factor with desired order of levels\navg_score$WORKPAY &lt;- factor(avg_score$WORKPAY, levels = c(\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"more than ten\"))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY, y=STU_REL_SCORE)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"lightblue\")+\n  ggtitle(\"How working affects student scores across the world\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student average score normalised relative to own country\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nIn which there does seem to be a negative correlation between number of times a student works and their relative score.\nThis is made clearer if we remove the violin distribution plots and just look at the averages. The times worked per week as contained within the PISA dataset is a categoric variable so in order to do a linear plot it needs to be made into a numeric variable first so the little bit of code below does that before then plotting a line graph.\n\navg_score &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, WORKPAY, ESCS) %&gt;% \n  mutate(SCORE_AVG = ((PV1MATH + PV1READ + PV1SCIE)/3)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CNT_AVG_SCORE = mean(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(CNT_SD_SCORE = sd(SCORE_AVG)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(STU_REL_SCORE = ((SCORE_AVG-CNT_AVG_SCORE)/CNT_SD_SCORE)) %&gt;% \n  select(CNT, SCORE_AVG, CNT_AVG_SCORE, CNT_SD_SCORE, STU_REL_SCORE, WORKPAY,ESCS) %&gt;%\n  mutate(WORKPAY_numeric = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY_numeric))\n\nggplot(data = avg_score,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY_numeric, y=STU_REL_SCORE)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)+\n  ggtitle(\"How working affects student scores across the world\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student average score normalised relative to own country\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nWhich does show more clearly a negative correlation between times worked per week when times is less than 5. The correlation gets a little more noisy after that. I speculate this is because working more than 5 times per week would mean working more than every weekday, which might mean students answering the questionnaire with larger numbers may be defining a “working” period differently than those answering with smaller values or perhaps have misread the question making the data noisier for values over 5.\nOne thing in discussion with Peter and Richard I realised was that this model while it takes account of differences in economic status by country, it does not take into account differences in socioeconomic status between students. It is completely plausible that even within a country poorer students might be having to work more than richer ones, and it is fairly established that students with lower socioeconomic status get lower scores on PISA tests (Tessier 2018). This might mean that all we are seeing in this graph is that effect, rather than any effect from working in a job. To remedy this we can adapt our model to control for socioeconomic status (ESCS).\n\n\n\nFirst of all let’s see if there is a relationship between a student working in a job and their ESCS.\n\nescs_vs_work &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  select(WORKPAY, ESCS) %&gt;% \n  mutate(WORKPAY_numeric = \n           case_when(WORKPAY == \"No work for pay\" ~ 0,\n                     WORKPAY == \"1 time of working for pay per week\" ~ 1,\n                     WORKPAY == \"2 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 2,\n                     WORKPAY == \"3 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 3,\n                     WORKPAY == \"4 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 4,\n                     WORKPAY == \"5 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 5,\n                     WORKPAY == \"6 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 6,\n                     WORKPAY == \"7 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 7,\n                     WORKPAY == \"8 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 8,\n                     WORKPAY == \"9 times of working for pay per week\" ~ 9,\n                     WORKPAY == \"10 or more times of working for pay per week\" ~ NA,\n                     .default = NA)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WORKPAY_numeric)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(ESCS))\n\nggplot(data = escs_vs_work,\n       aes(x=WORKPAY_numeric, y=ESCS)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)+\n  ggtitle(\"Do low socioeconomic status students work more times a week?\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  xlab(\"Number of times worked per week\") +\n  ylab(\"Student socioeconomic status\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width=0.9))\n\n\n\n\nClearly there is a negative correlation, students who work more times per week are also of lower socioeconomic status. An interesting aside that I cannot explain is that odd working times per week lower than 5 have higher ESCS and even working times above 5 have higher ESCS. I think this may be because the WORKPAY category is a composite category made from two questions “How many times in the last week did you work for pay after school?” and “How many times in the last week did you work for pay before school?” This is pure speculation but perhaps there is some difference in ESCS between students who work before and after school, and the way the two questions are being aggregated is showing that up. I could possibly use the full PISA data set to look at the responses to those individual questions but that would perhaps be a distraction from the current investigation.\nLet’s compare the correlations between WORKPAY and ESCS to see how much they are correlated.\n\ncor.test(escs_vs_work$WORKPAY_numeric, escs_vs_work$ESCS, method = \"pearson\")\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  escs_vs_work$WORKPAY_numeric and escs_vs_work$ESCS\nt = -50.101, df = 529231, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.07138745 -0.06602455\nsample estimates:\n        cor \n-0.06870649 \n\n\nWhile the relationship is incredibly significant (p &lt; 2.2e-16), there is only a small negative correlation (-0.0687).
